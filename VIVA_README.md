## About the Repository

This repository contains LaTeX source files and documentation for various laboratory experiments. It aims to provide students with structured templates and examples for documenting lab work using LaTeX.

## Key LaTeX Concepts

- **Document Structure:** Understand the basic structure (`\documentclass`, `\begin{document}`, `\end{document}`).
- **Sections and Subsections:** Usage of `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, etc.
- **Mathematical Typesetting:** Writing equations using `$...$`, `\[ ... \]`, and environments like `align` or `equation`.
- **Tables and Figures:** Inserting tables (`tabular`), figures (`figure`), and referencing them within the document.
- **Packages:** Common packages like `amsmath`, `graphicx`, `geometry`, and their purposes.
- **Bibliography:** Managing references with `thebibliography` or BibTeX.
