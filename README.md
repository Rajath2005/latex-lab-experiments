# 🧪 LaTeX Lab Programs for VTU | B.E/B.Tech

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX lab programs designed for academic lab practice and preparation for lab exams, especially aligned with VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) syllabus. Each `.tex` file demonstrates a different LaTeX feature or document structure — from basic formatting to complex algorithms and diagrams.

## 📘 Introduction to LaTeX

**LaTeX** (pronounced *Lay-tech* or *Lah-tech*) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is widely used in academia for:

- Technical reports
- Theses and dissertations
- Academic journals
- Books and presentations

> **Why Learn LaTeX?**
- Perfect formatting of mathematical equations
- Structured documents with automated referencing
- Version control-friendly (plain text)
- Open-source and widely adopted

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **TeXstudio**: LaTeX editor used for writing and compiling `.tex` files.
- **Git + GitHub**: For version control and cloud backup.
- **TikZ**: To draw diagrams and tree structures.
- **Algorithm Packages**: For writing and formatting algorithms.

## About the Repository

This repository contains LaTeX source files and documentation for various laboratory experiments. It aims to provide students with structured templates and examples for documenting lab work using LaTeX.

---

## Key LaTeX Concepts

- **Document Structure:** Understand the basic structure (`\documentclass`, `\begin{document}`, `\end{document}`).
- **Sections and Subsections:** Usage of `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, etc.
- **Mathematical Typesetting:** Writing equations using `$...$`, `\[ ... \]`, and environments like `align` or `equation`.
- **Tables and Figures:** Inserting tables (`tabular`), figures (`figure`), and referencing them within the document.
- **Packages:** Common packages like `amsmath`, `graphicx`, `geometry`, and their purposes.
- **Bibliography:** Managing references with `thebibliography` or BibTeX.

---

## Common Viva Questions
