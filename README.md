# 🧪 LaTeX Lab Programs for VTU | B.E/B.Tech

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX lab programs designed for academic lab practice and preparation for lab exams, especially aligned with VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) syllabus. Each `.tex` file demonstrates a different LaTeX feature or document structure — from basic formatting to complex algorithms and diagrams.

## 📘 Introduction to LaTeX

**LaTeX** (pronounced *Lay-tech* or *Lah-tech*) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is widely used in academia for:

- Technical reports
- Theses and dissertations
- Academic journals
- Books and presentations

> **Why Learn LaTeX?**
- Perfect formatting of mathematical equations
- Structured documents with automated referencing
- Version control-friendly (plain text)
- Open-source and widely adopted

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **TeXstudio**: LaTeX editor used for writing and compiling `.tex` files.
- **Git + GitHub**: For version control and cloud backup.
- **TikZ**: To draw diagrams and tree structures.
- **Algorithm Packages**: For writing and formatting algorithms.
